# Lens: A Study Viewer

Lens is the evolution of [Cut](https://cut.social/), a platform that facilitates rapid development and deployment of interactive research instruments. Examples include: 

* [2-Alternative-Forced-Chocie Task](https://lens.cut.social/#/gonogo/en)
* [Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)](https://lens.cut.social/#/bart/en)
* [Stroop Task](https://lens.cut.social/#/stroop/en)
* [Ultiamtum Game](https://lens.cut.social/#/ultimatum/en)
* [Dictator Game](https://lens.cut.social/#/dictator/en)
* [Task Switch](https://lens.cut.social/#/taskswitch/en)
* [Go/NoGo](https://lens.cut.social/#/gonogoalt/en)
* [N-back](https://lens.cut.social/#/nback/en)

Lens uses React and Material UI to structure the development process while simplifying the study design for experimenters and providing a streamlined experience to respondents. It works by sending users a JSON file containing the tasks and questions and collecting their responses in the same format. See the details [here](https://sites.google.com/view/msrad/cut?authuser=0). 

This architecture provides several other functionalities, in addition to facilitating the integration of interactive tasks with conventional survey elements:

* Multilingual survey content with minimial effort
* Device adaptive research instruments
* Markdown texts formatting

We obtained funding from the New School and the Association for Psychological Science (APS) to develop this tool. Research using this platform has been published in the *Journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin*:

* Rad, M. S., Ansarinia, M., & Shafir, E. (2023). Temporary self-deprivation can impair cognitive control: evidence from the Ramadan fast. Personality and social psychology bulletin, 49(3), 415-428. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211070385

And more is on the way! This is an ongoing project so your feedback and suggesitons would be much appreciated. Thanks! :)
